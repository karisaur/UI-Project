Processing files (.pde) can be opened in any text editor such as Notepad++, but preferrably should be
opened in Processing regardless of if you have the Android Environment.

With Processing, you can open any of the .pde files, and the other classes will import.
If you're not using Processing, you will need to open all the .pde files separately.
